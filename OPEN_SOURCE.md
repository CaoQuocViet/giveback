# Open Source Code

## Reused Components

The **news** section in the GIVEBACK frontend is reused from the open-source project [Blog Template using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/webexpe13/blog-template-using-nextjs-typescript-tailwindcss). The original project provides basic UI templates and functionalities for managing and displaying news, which helped us save development time and focus on customization to meet GIVEBACK's specific needs.

## Modifications

While reusing code from the original project, we have made significant modifications to meet GIVEBACK's requirements, including:

- **User Interface Customization:**
  - Changed colors, fonts, and layouts to align with GIVEBACK's branding.
  - Added logos and other brand identity elements to the interface.

- **News Management Functionality:**
  - Integrated features to categorize news according to specific charity campaigns.
  - Added the ability to filter and search news by keywords and dates.

- **Performance and Security Improvements:**
  - Optimized code to enhance page load speed and user responsiveness.
  - Implemented additional security measures to protect user data and news information.

- **Integration with GIVEBACK System:**
  - Connected the news section with GIVEBACK's charity campaign management system.
  - Added API endpoints to retrieve and update news from GIVEBACK's backend.
